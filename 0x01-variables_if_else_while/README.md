# **0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while**


The project files and the resources in this directory covers the following concenpts and objectives<br>
> * What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
> * What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
> * What the the relational operators and how to use them
> * What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C

> * How to use the if, if ... else statements
> * How to use comments
> * How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
> * How to assign values to variables
> * How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
> * How to use the while loop
> * How to use variables with the while loop
> * How to print variables using printf
> * What is the ASCII character set
> * What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

# **Tasks**
[0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c)<br>
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.


> * You can find the source code here
> * The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
> * You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
> * The output of the program should be:
> * The number, followed by
> * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
> * if the number is 0: is zero
> * if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
